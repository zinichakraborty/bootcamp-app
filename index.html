            <p1>My Girl Scouts Gold Award project was the culmination of my years of dedication to the troop. For my project, I used my knowledge of machine learning to combat the lack of young girls passionate about having an education in computer science in college. I did this by designing and leading my own Artificial Intelligence workshops at the Girl Scouts STEM Center where young girl scouts are able to sign up for free workshops on a specific topic. In my workshop, I created multiple activities and games to play to convey a general understanding of machine learning concepts while keeping them engaged and interested to continue learning.</p1>
